# How to track for a multiworld tournament restream on oottracker.fenhl.net

* You will receive a link to your tracker page, which includes all the item cells you're responsible for.
* You should watch your runner's stream directly so your tracking isn't affected by restream delay (and because your runner's feed may not always be shown in a reasonable size on the restream). If watching via `streamlink`, the recommended delay setting is `--hls-live-edge=5`, which is the same as the restream's.
    * You also have the option to listen to the commentary live via Discord. If you do, please remain muted for the duration of the call.
* Some cells have different functionality when right-clicked. One that isn't obvious is the bomb bag, which toggles bombchus when right-clicked.
* The dungeon reward locations shown on the restream are based on the status of your tracker and the tracker for the same world on the other team. The info should only be entered by one of you, as entering the info in both trackers causes a minor visual glitch on the restream.
* Right-click the bottle cell when Ruto's letter is found or when starting with open fountain. Unlike on ZSR restreams, Ruto's letter or a big Poe should not be marked as a bottle until turned in.
* The tunic and magic cells are only shown for the 2 runners whose view is collapsed, but should always be kept up to date so that they're correct when the restream changes layouts.
* There is a cell for the “progression mode” of your runner, i.e. normal play, go mode, BK mode, or finished. Please set it as follows:
    * Set to finished if the runner has completed or forfeited the race on racetime.gg. This mode is shown with no icon since the restream will display the runner's final time in that position.
    * Set to BK mode if the runner can't do any more checks that can have progression. If you see that your runner is waiting for items from their teammates, mark them as BK mode unless you know they missed a check.
    * Set to go mode if the team either has or knows the location of every item the runner (not the entire team) requires to finish the game. This can be difficult to keep track of especially in multiworld, but it's okay to just set it according to what the runners, commentary, and/or Twtich chat are saying. If a required item has multiple locations where it can be, but they're all in the same hint area and all requirements for those locations are likewise known or obtained, that counts as being in go mode.
        * If a runner is both in go mode and in BK mode (e.g. they're standing in front of Ganondorf's boss room waiting for a teammate to send them their hinted light arrows), mark them as BK mode.
    * If none of the above apply, set to normal play.
* The magic cell also shows the Lens of Truth. This is a starting item, so please mark it at the start of the race.
* Please right-click a song cell when that song's location is checked (e.g. right-click Nocturne when your runner gets the Burning Kakariko cutscene, regardless of which song or item it gives them).
