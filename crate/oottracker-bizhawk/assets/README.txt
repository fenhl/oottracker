HOW TO INSTALL/UPDATE

1. The main oottracker app is required. You can download it from https://github.com/fenhl/oottracker/releases/latest/download/oottracker-win64.exe
2. You will need BizHawk version 2.5.x.
3. Move the files OotAutoTracker.dll and oottracker.dll into the ExternalTools subfolder within your BizHawk folder (the BizHawk folder is the one with EmuHawk.exe in it).

HOW TO USE

1. Open the main oottracker app
2. Open EmuHawk.exe
3. In BizHawk, go to Tools menu > External Tool > OoT OotAutoTracker
4. A window will open. You can minimize it, but closing it will stop the auto-tracker.
5. Open the ROM. The main oottracker app should now automatically update based on your item status.
