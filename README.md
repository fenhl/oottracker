**Warning:** As of 2020-11-03, [the racing rules](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Rules#Universal_Rules) prohibit all usage of trackers capable of auto-tracking even in manual mode. How exactly this applies to my tracker is unclear pending discussion with the RaceMods.

This is [Fenhl](https://github.com/fenhl)'s tracker for [the *Ocarina of Time* Item Randomizer](https://ootrandomizer.com/). Current features include:

* Runs on Windows and macOS, also available as [a web app](https://oottracker.fenhl.net/)
* Support for auto-tracking with [BizHawk](http://tasvideos.org/BizHawk.html) or [RetroArch](https://retroarch.com/)
* Can connect to the networked trackers <https://oot-tracker.web.app/> and <https://ootr-random-settings-tracker.web.app/>
