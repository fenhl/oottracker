**Warning:** As of 2021-11-15, [the racing rules](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Rules#Universal_Rules) prohibit all usage of trackers capable of auto-tracking even in manual mode. How exactly this applies to my tracker is unclear pending a decision from the RaceMods.

This is [Fenhl](https://github.com/fenhl)'s tracker for [the *Ocarina of Time* Item Randomizer](https://ootrandomizer.com/). Current features include:

* Runs on Windows and macOS, also available as [a web app](https://oottracker.fenhl.net/)
* Support for auto-tracking with [BizHawk](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk), [Project64](https://www.pj64-emu.com/), or [RetroArch](https://retroarch.com/)
